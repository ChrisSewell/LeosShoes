# üêæ Paw Burn Risk Assessment Tool

A Python application that assesses paw burn risk for dogs based on weather conditions including temperature, UV index, and other environmental factors. The tool provides hourly risk scores, recommendations for protective footwear, and visualizations to help keep your furry friend safe.

## Features

- **Weather Data Integration**: Fetches historical, current, and forecast weather data from WeatherAPI.com
- **Smart Risk Scoring**: Calculates risk scores based on multiple factors:
  - Air temperature (80¬∞F, 90¬∞F, 100¬∞F+ thresholds)
  - UV index (6, 8, 10+ thresholds)
  - Weather conditions (sunny/clear conditions)
  - Accumulated heat (rolling 2-hour average)
  - Surface recovery time (cooling after peak temperatures)
  - Rapid temperature swings detection
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Provides actionable advice on when to use protective dog shoes
- **Data Persistence**: Stores weather and risk data in SQLite database
- **Rich Visualizations**: Creates comprehensive plots and dashboards
- **Configurable Parameters**: Customize thresholds and assessment criteria
- **Terminal Output**: Clean, formatted output for development and monitoring

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run a basic risk assessment for your default location:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
python main.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -l, --location TEXT     Specify location (city, zip code, coordinates)
  -d, --detailed         Show detailed hourly breakdown
  -p, --plot            Display interactive plots
  -s, --save-plots      Save plots to files
  --no-recommendations  Skip recommendations output
  --config-check        Check configuration and exit
```

### Examples

**Basic assessment for a specific location:**
```bash
python main.py --location "Phoenix, AZ"
```

**Using zip codes:**
```bash
python main.py --location "85001"  # Phoenix, AZ zip code
python main.py --location "90210"  # Beverly Hills, CA zip code
```

**Detailed hourly breakdown with plots:**
```bash
python main.py --detailed --plot
```

**Save plots for reporting:**
```bash
python main.py --save-plots --location "Las Vegas, NV"
# Plots saved to plots/ directory (auto-created and cleared each run)
```

**Combine detailed analysis with plots:**
```bash
python main.py --location "90210" --detailed --save-plots
```

## Risk Scoring System

The tool uses a comprehensive scoring system (0-10 scale) with the following components:

### Temperature Score
- +1 if ‚â• 80¬∞F
- +2 if ‚â• 90¬∞F  
- +3 if ‚â• 100¬∞F

### UV Index Score
- +1 if ‚â• 6
- +2 if ‚â• 8
- +3 if ‚â• 10

### Weather Condition Score
- +1 if sunny or clear conditions

### Accumulated Heat Score
- +1 if 2-hour rolling average temperature > 85¬∞F OR average UV ‚â• 6

### Surface Recovery Score
- -1 if > 2 hours since last 90¬∞F+ reading (cooling bonus)

### Additional Factors
- +0.5 bonus for rapid temperature swings (15¬∞F+ change in 1 hour)

**Shoe Recommendation Threshold**: ‚â• 6.0 (configurable)

## Configuration

All parameters can be customized via environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Temperature thresholds (¬∞F)
TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW=80
TEMP_THRESHOLD_MED=90
TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH=100

# UV Index thresholds
UV_THRESHOLD_LOW=6
UV_THRESHOLD_MED=8
UV_THRESHOLD_HIGH=10

# Risk assessment
RISK_THRESHOLD_SHOES=6
ROLLING_WINDOW_HOURS=2
SURFACE_RECOVERY_HOURS=2

# Surface recovery enhancements (Optional)
SURFACE_RECOVERY_TEMP_THRESHOLD=90   # Temperature threshold to start recovery period (¬∞F)
SURFACE_TYPE=asphalt                 # Options: asphalt, concrete, mixed, grass
SURFACE_MAX_RECOVERY_SCORE=2.0       # Maximum recovery score reduction with graduated recovery
ENABLE_GRADUATED_RECOVERY=true       # Enable graduated recovery (more cooling time = more benefit)
ENABLE_TIME_OF_DAY_FACTOR=true       # Apply day/night cooling adjustments
```

### Surface Recovery Feature

The application includes an enhanced surface recovery model that accounts for cooling of surfaces after peak temperatures:

- **Basic Recovery**: Surfaces begin to cool after being exposed to high temperatures (above `SURFACE_RECOVERY_TEMP_THRESHOLD`). After `SURFACE_RECOVERY_HOURS`, a recovery credit reduces the risk score.

- **Graduated Recovery**: When enabled, provides a progressively stronger recovery benefit as more cooling time passes, up to `SURFACE_MAX_RECOVERY_SCORE`.

- **Surface Type**: Different surfaces cool at different rates:
  - Asphalt: Slowest cooling (coefficient 0.7)
  - Concrete: Moderate cooling (coefficient 0.85)
  - Mixed: Standard cooling (coefficient 1.0)
  - Grass: Fastest cooling (coefficient 1.5)

- **Time-of-Day**: When enabled, night hours (7pm-6am) provide 30% faster cooling than daylight hours.

- **Sun Exposure**: The algorithm considers sun exposure during the recovery period, which can slow cooling by up to 30%.

These factors combine to provide a more accurate assessment of surface temperatures throughout the day and the resulting paw burn risk.
